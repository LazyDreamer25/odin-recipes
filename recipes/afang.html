        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Afang soup is a rich, Nigerian vegetable soup made primarily from 
            two leafy greens: pounded Afang leaves (also known as Okazi) 
            and water leaves, combined with a flavorful blend of meats, fish, 
            and seafood. Originating from the Efik and Ibibio people of Cross River 
            and Akwa Ibom States in Southern Nigeria, this hearty and nutritious soup 
            is a celebratory dish often served at festivals and special occasions. </p>
