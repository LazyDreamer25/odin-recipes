        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Okra soup is a popular West African, particularly Nigerian, soup featuring chopped
             okra as a key ingredient, combined with various meats or fish, spices, 
             and sometimes vegetables like spinach or Ugu leaf. It is known for its
              distinct slimy texture, a result of the okra, and is often served with 
              staples like fufu, eba, or pounded yam. Okra soup is valued for being 
              nutritious and relatively easy to prepare.  </p>
